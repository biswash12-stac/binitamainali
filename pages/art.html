                    <div class="art-text-content">
                        <p>Art plays a crucial role in the developmental stages of childhood as a means of self-expression and exploration for young ones. It provides children with the opportunity to delve into their thoughts and emotions while shaping their sense of self. Participating in art activities helps boost confidence levels and fosters creativity. Moreover, it aids in developing problem-solving abilities and fine motor skills.</p>
                        <p>Art encourages trying new things and expressing oneself uniquely. It plays a vital role in nurturing creativity across all areas of growth. As Isbell and Yoshizawa (2016) suggest, engaging in artistic endeavors enables children to comprehend the emotional aspects of their surroundings, particularly during periods when their language skills are still developing.</p>
